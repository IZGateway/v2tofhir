# Hotfix Release Workflow
# Run this workflow from a 'hotfix/<version>' branch to create a hotfix release.
# For standard releases from develop, use the release.yml workflow instead.
#
# Hotfix Process:
# 1. Manually create hotfix branch from main: git checkout -b hotfix/<version> main
# 2. Developers create fix/<issue> branches from hotfix/<version>
# 3. PRs are merged back to hotfix/<version>
# 4. When ready, run this workflow from the hotfix/<version> branch
#
# Note: Unlike the standard release workflow, hotfix releases do NOT include a 'next-snapshot-version'
# input. Hotfixes are emergency fixes to production that are merged back to both main and develop.
# The develop branch version is managed separately through standard releases, so hotfixes don't
# bump the develop version during the release process.
